Code Review Questions:
--------------------
1. Why have you made these changes?
2. What will these changes do to help later?
3. What's the difference between my implementation and yours?
4. How does it make the code cleaner and more reusable?

Please explain everything with examples.

Function References:
------------------
- highest_stats_game()
- get_a_team(cls, team, The_game, look_good=False)
- get_all_players_game_stats(data, players_name)

Report Generation Example:
------------------------
````python
report += "\n Game-by-Game Stats:\n"
for game, stats in game_stats.items():
    stat_line = ", ".join([f"{k}: {v}" for k, v in stats.items()])
    report += f"    {game}: {stat_line}\n"

Claude Remember Chat:
-------------------
This is from another chat remember it he was a good guy

Hey apparently this chat is too long so i going start a new one in a differnt chat can you remember everything pleaseeee

I can't remember anything from this chat in a new one - each conversation is completely separate and I have no memory between them.
What you should do:
1. Save your current `player_report.py` file (you already have it)
2. In the new chat, share that file with me
3. Tell me what you need next (we were working on the last two functions: `game_rating` and `season_game_rating`)
Quick summary for the new chat:
* You have a PyQt5 basketball stats app
* 4/6 features are done: Quick Stats, Compare Games, Grading, Highlights
* Still need: Game Rating (individual game) and Season Game Rating (all games)
* We just wrote `show_game_rating()` and `format_game_rating_html()`
* Need to: connect button, update `back_to_main_menu()`, then do `season_game_rating`
Start the new chat with your current code and I'll pick up where we left off!
