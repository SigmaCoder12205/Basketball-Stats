                                                Rules
        1. All sub menus and main menus have to be formatted in =


                                                    Transferring Data

We need functions for the main menu. For now, I will make functions that are all in the back and won't be seen by the user.
Some ideas... transferring data from function to function (A to B), or maybe we make a separate class to handle transferring all the data?
It could be cleaner and easier to access, and the main menu class could just inherit it.
If we were to make it, how could we make it and what would we need to make it?                                                          GO TO playground.py Date: 6/09/25 Date left: 20/09/25 Reason: So to help work on PlayerReport

So we've got the base - it just loads data from Data.json, then outputs it out and has error handling.
What if anything to do directly with the data goes through the class transdata?                                                          GO TO playground.py Date: 7/09/25 Date left: None

I'm writing a different version of transdata and renaming it to AccessData. It doesn't have as many functions
as transdata but only gets necessary stats from Data.json.

I thought of a good function: specific_player_best_stat. It only gets the quarter in which the player
got the most of a stat, but not the total. For example, Myles got his most points (3) in quarter 2, but what about 
quarter 1? So if I were to add them together, maybe it would be different.                                                               WORK ON LATER Date: 16/08/2025 


                                                    Team Report

Maybe a big function like improvement, but it's not for a specific player - it's for the entire team.
Have stuff like:
    - Average stats (Points, Fouls, Rebounds, Assists, Turnovers)
    - Comparing players (has stuff like biggest differences and more)
    - Grading (like A+ B+ etc.)
    - Every Game review

Maybe this could be its own sub menu.

                                                       Main Menu

__init__ will start off the main function and show the user a main menu.                                                                 GO TO designs.txt to see design
The user will make their choice, and it will go through some tests to check if the input is okay and continue.
What option 1 will do is use the functions from details.py.
Same with options 2 and 3 - just take the functions from those files and use them from there.
They will all have their sub menus because soon I'll put all the functions into a class so it's easy to access and use the classes for that.
